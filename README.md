Visual twin detection is a deep learning project that leverages Siamese Networks with ResNet-50 backbone to identify visually similar image pairs â€” essentially, it finds your image twin! The model is trained and evaluated on the Totally-Looks-Like dataset using Hugging Faceâ€™s accelerate library for seamless device management.
